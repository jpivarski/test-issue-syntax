        Thank you for submitting an issue! (I know that it takes time and effort to do so.)

        Note that we'll be closing the issue as soon as a solution is proposed. This is not meant to be unfriendly; it's for our own bookkeeping. If you think the first answer/solution is unsatisfactory, please do continue the thread and we'll reopen it or otherwise address it

        What version of Awkward Array are you using?

        You can discover this by running
        ```python
        >>> import awkward as ak
        >>> ak.__version__
        ```

        If this is *not* the [latest version](https://pypi.org/project/awkward/), you should update to check whether the bug still exists.
