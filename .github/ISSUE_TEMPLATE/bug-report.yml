        Thank you for submitting an issue! (I know that it takes time and effort to do so.)

        Note that we'll be closing the issue as soon as a solution is proposed. This is not meant to be unfriendly; it's for our own bookkeeping. If you think the first answer/solution is unsatisfactory, please do continue the thread and we'll reopen it or otherwise address it.

        What version of Awkward Array are you using? You can discover this by running

        ```python
        >>> import awkward as ak
        >>> ak.__version__
        ```

        If this is *not* the [latest version](https://pypi.org/project/awkward/), please update and check to see if the bug still exists.

        Describe what you attempted to do, with code to reproduce it (in [backticks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)), what you expected that code to do, and what it did instead.

        If your code example requires data, be sure to include it in a way that is publicly accessible. (Hint: you can [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) Awkward Arrays and drag the pickle files into GitHub issues. That's probably the easiest way to supply an example.)
