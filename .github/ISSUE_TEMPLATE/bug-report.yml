        - What did you attempt to do? Include code so that we can reproduce it (in [backticks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)).
        - What did you expect it to do?
        - What did it do instead? (Include full log output in [backticks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks). Copy-pasted text is better than screenshots.)

        If your code example requires data, be sure to include it in a way that is publicly accessible, such as **clicking on the rectangle below to highlight it** and then dragging the file in. (You can [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) Awkward Arrays, but verify that the issue applies to pickled arrays as well as the original arrays.)
