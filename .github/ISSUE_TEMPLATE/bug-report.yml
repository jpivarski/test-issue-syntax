        Describe what you attempted to do, with code to reproduce it (in [backticks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)), what you expected that code to do, and what it did instead.

        If your code example requires data, be sure to include it in a way that is publicly accessible. (Hint: you can [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) Awkward Arrays, but verify that the issue applies to pickled arrays as well as the original arrays.)
