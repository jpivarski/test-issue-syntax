        The goal of these issues is to fix performance "mistakes," instances where a fix would make the majority of applications several times faster or more, not fine-tuning an application or trading performance in one case for another (unless the former is a very rare or unusual case).

        To prove that something is a performance mistake, it needs to have a reproducible metric and a demonstration that shows how fast it could be in bare metal, such as equivalent C or Numba code. If the comparison is truly equivalent (i.e. a general-purpose function is not compared with a highly specialized one), we'll try to optimize the metric within a factor of 2 or so of the baseline.

        Alternatively, if you've found a mistake in the code that would always be faster if fixed, we can fix it without tests. Some bugs are obvious.

        If your code example requires data, be sure to include it in a way that is publicly accessible, such as **clicking on the rectangle below to highlight it** and then dragging the file in. (You can [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) Awkward Arrays, but verify that the issue applies to pickled arrays as well as the original arrays.)
